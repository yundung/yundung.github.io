## Navigating BUDA: Search Features that Empower Research

BUDA offers an intuitive, yet multifaceted search system that caters to diverse research needs within Tibetan Buddhist studies.

### Person Search: Connecting Biographies and Texts

Searching for persons in BUDA reveals detailed biographical profiles, linked writings, and related figures, enriching understanding of historical and religious contexts. Filters for name variants, birth year, role, tradition, and gender help resolve common ambiguities and pinpoint relevant individuals.

This interconnected data reflects the lived networks behind Tibetan Buddhist textual production, supporting both prosopographic studies and traditional scholarship.

### Place Search: Mapping Sacred Geography

Place records provide geographic coordinates, alternative names, and linked persons and texts, enabling spatial exploration of Tibetan Buddhist culture. The interactive map adds a dynamic dimension, inviting users to situate textual materials within their cultural and historical landscapes.

This geospatial approach fosters new perspectives on textual circulation and monastic or pilgrimage sites, expanding the scope of traditional research.

### Collection Search: Accessing Curated Text Groupings

With over 100 collections aggregated, BUDA enables targeted exploration of libraries and archives, filtering by language, author, topic, and print or manuscript status. This allows scholars to balance deep dives into specific corpora with serendipitous discovery across the broader Tibetan textual heritage.

Tracking provenance and collection metadata further anchors research in material history and institutional contexts.

### Topic Search: Thematic Pathways through Complex Traditions

Thematic search connects researchers with variant terminology and related resources, bridging linguistic and conceptual differences. This feature helps users navigate Buddhist philosophy, ritual, medicine, and more, reflecting BUDA‚Äôs role in facilitating interdisciplinary study.
