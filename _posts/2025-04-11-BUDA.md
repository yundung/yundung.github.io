To provide open access to its extensive collection, BDRC developed the [Buddhist Digital Archives (BUDA)](https://www.bdrc.io/buda-archive/), a powerful online platform that serves as a collaborative archive and research tool.

> "BUDA is easy, intuitive, and fast. It features a state-of-the-art image viewer, a sophisticated data structure, and an advanced search that places our vast archive and those of our partner institutions right at your fingertips."

## Exploring the Vast Collection of Tibetan and Buddhist Literature on BUDA
BUDA is built as an open-source platform based on open standards, designed for free use and easy access. At its core are two key technologies: the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Linked Open Data.[^1]
- IIIF enables BUDA to provide a rich, user-friendly interface for viewing, downloading, annotating, and sharing high-quality images of Buddhist manuscripts‚Äîcapabilities far beyond previous systems
- BUDA‚Äôs Linked Open Data architecture structures information in a machine-readable, interconnected way, allowing seamless linking and querying across datasets. This not only supports long-term preservation but also creates a dynamic, globally accessible scholarly hub that connects texts, people, places, and historical contexts within Buddhist cultural heritage.

This digital platform allows for accessing an extensive collection of Tibetan and Buddhist texts in multiple languages, including Tibetan, Sanskrit, Chinese, Pali, Burmese, and Khmer.

### How to Use BUDA: A Step-by-Step Guide

#### Utilize the Search Function

The [BUDA homepage](https://library.bdrc.io) features a central search bar that supports a wide range of queries. A simple search allows users to enter a keyword directly, such as a title, name, or topic, using either original scripts or transliterations.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/buda-01-search.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

For more precise results, the advanced search function enables users to specify where to search: within works, texts, e-texts, authors, persons, places, topics, or collections. Search results can be further refined using filters such as language, version, person, place, and subject.

#### Explore Linked Data ("Rebonds")

BUDA employs a system of interconnected data that facilitates navigation between related records. For example, a user may move from a work to its various versions, to the author‚Äôs biographical information, or to other works by the same person. This interconnected structure supports discovery and contextual exploration of related materials.

#### Access and Download Digital Manuscripts

High-resolution digital scans of manuscripts are available for page-by-page browsing or full-text reading. Registered users may download complete works as PDF or image files. Non-registered visitors typically have access to the first and last 20 pages of most texts.

#### Make Use of the E-Text Reader and Research Tools

In addition to scanned images, many works are available as searchable e-texts, allowing for efficient keyword searches and text navigation. BUDA also provides access to bibliographic information and links to related resources to support research activities.

#### Engage with an Open Access Platform and Expanding Network

As an open-source platform, BUDA is committed to open access principles. While the majority of content is freely accessible, some materials may require registration. The platform continues to grow through collaborations with monasteries, libraries, and research institutions worldwide.

#### Person Search: Connecting Biographies and Texts

Searching for persons in BUDA reveals detailed biographical profiles, linked writings, and related figures, enriching understanding of historical and religious contexts. Filters for name variants, birth year, role, tradition, and gender help resolve common ambiguities and pinpoint relevant individuals.

This interconnected data reflects the lived networks behind Tibetan Buddhist textual production, supporting both prosopographic studies and traditional scholarship.

#### Place Search: Mapping Sacred Geography

Place records provide geographic coordinates, alternative names, and linked persons and texts, enabling spatial exploration of Tibetan Buddhist culture. The interactive map adds a dynamic dimension, inviting users to situate textual materials within their cultural and historical landscapes.

This geospatial approach fosters new perspectives on textual circulation and monastic or pilgrimage sites, expanding the scope of traditional research.

#### Collection Search: Accessing Curated Text Groupings

With over 100 collections aggregated, BUDA enables targeted exploration of libraries and archives, filtering by language, author, topic, and print or manuscript status. This allows scholars to balance deep dives into specific corpora with serendipitous discovery across the broader Tibetan textual heritage.

Tracking provenance and collection metadata further anchors research in material history and institutional contexts.

#### Topic Search: Thematic Pathways through Complex Traditions

Thematic search connects researchers with variant terminology and related resources, bridging linguistic and conceptual differences. This feature helps users navigate Buddhist philosophy, ritual, medicine, and more, reflecting BUDA‚Äôs role in facilitating interdisciplinary study.
