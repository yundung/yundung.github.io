### Navigating BUDA: Search Features that Empower Research

As outlined in a previous post, BUDA provides a wide range of tools designed to support access, analysis, and discovery: From navigating linked data to using the integrated e-text reader or downloading high-quality digital manuscripts. Building on this foundation, the search functionality plays a central role in locating specific persons, places, or texts within the archive. With its flexible filters, phonetic and multilingual input options, and structured metadata, BUDA’s search interface offers an efficient and precise way to explore the breadth of its collections.

By default, the search function is set to “Versions”, meaning that any query will return results corresponding to specific instances or editions of texts (such as print editions, block prints, or digital scans) and is generally used to search for texts by their titles.

However, by switching to "Advanced Search" in the main search bar, it becomes possible to refine the type of content being queried. On the right-hand side of the search bar, a dropdown menu allows for the selection of specific search categories. These include: *Works, Texts, Etexts, Persons, Places, Topics, and Collections*. [^1]

For the purposes of this post, only three of these categories will be introduced: Persons, Places, and Topics. Each serves as a different starting point for exploring BUDA’s organised data and vast digital holdings.
