## Why This Reflection?

After four blogposts exploring the **history**, **mission**, and **technological foundation** of the **Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC)** and its platform **BUDA**, I want to end this series on a more *personal* note. My previous entries aimed to present BDRC's work in a clear and objective way. This final post, by contrast, is written from **my own perspective as a potential user** of BUDA. *What does it actually feel like to use this platform?* What are its **strengths**, its **challenges**, and its **possibilities** for someone like me?

This reflection is shaped by my own position, which sits at a **unique intersection**. I am a **student of Central Asian and Tibetan Studies** as well as **Digital Humanities**. I am *digitally interested* and already familiar with some **Tibetan Buddhist literature**. At the same time, I am a **Swiss-born Tibetan**, *fluent in colloquial Tibetan*, with **reading skills that are still developing**. **English** is the more natural language for me when doing research. And beyond all that, I am also a **practicing Buddhist**, which means my interest in BUDA is both **scholarly and personal**. These **overlapping identities** shape my experience of the platform in ways that are sometimes *empowering*, sometimes *overwhelming*.

## First Impressions

Opening **BUDA** for the first time, I felt **genuinely impressed**. The interface is **clean**, the speed is **excellent**, and - importantly - it is **openly accessible**. There is *no need to register or log in* to start exploring. This reflects **BDRC’s values of openness and inclusivity**.

At the same time, the **simplicity of the design** masks the platform’s **underlying complexity**. BUDA is not just a **library of scanned texts**. It is a **sophisticated metadata system**, a **digital preservation platform**, and a **research tool** all at once. It took me *some time* to grasp how everything is structured and how best to search for the materials I was looking for.

## Using BUDA > Between Language, Practice, and Research

My experience of using BUDA is deeply shaped by the **intersection** of my roles as a *practitioner* and a *researcher*, as well as by my *linguistic situation*.

As someone raised in Switzerland in a Tibetan family, I can speak and understand Tibetan fluently, but my ability to **read texts** is still a work in progress. I can read Tibetan, but not yet well enough to fully engage with most canonical works. This makes the **English interface essential** for me and, I believe, for many young Tibetans in the diaspora. 

However, one issue I encountered is that **searching for texts** often requires inputting **keywords in Tibetan**, and even more specifically in **Wylie transliteration**. Typing in **Tibetan script** is already a challenge for me, and **Wylie** requires a *precise knowledge* of how Tibetan syllables are spelled - which can be difficult if your literacy is still developing.

BUDA has recently introduced a feature called **“Tibetan in phonetics”**, which is a **promising step toward more accessible searching**. If the platform could one day fully support **phonetic Romanized Tibetan** (*i.e., how we pronounce words*), that would be a **real breakthrough for users like me**. This would be especially valuable given that **typing in Wylie** requires *perfect spelling knowledge*.

However, using **phonetic Tibetan** also poses challenges, since there is currently **no widely accepted standard** for how Tibetan sounds should be rendered in Roman letters. Despite this, even a **flexible or adaptive phonetic search option** would significantly **lower the barrier** for users like me and make BUDA more accessible to a **broader audience**.

As a **Buddhist practitioner**, I would begin by going directly to the **“Tibetan Tradition”** section on BUDA’s homepage. From there, I usually select a specific **lineage**, for example, the **Kagyu school**. Because I already have some **background knowledge** of key figures and works from this tradition, I can **navigate the material more confidently**. I know what to look for, and I can recognize texts of interest.

However, I wonder how a **peer of mine**—also **Swiss-born and Tibetan**, but with *less experience in Buddhist study*—might find their way on the platform. Without some **foundational knowledge**, the **structure and terminology** of BUDA could be confusing.

## Strengths and Limitations

There is much to admire in **BUDA**. The quality of **digital scans** is excellent, the **metadata is detailed and carefully structured**, and the inclusion of **traditional classifications** helps to situate texts within the wider **Tibetan literary landscape**. The fact that I can **explore entire collections**, organized by **tradition**, **author**, or even **geographic origin**, is remarkable. As a *student* and *practitioner*, this feels like a **gift**.

And yet, there are also **limits** to what I can currently do. While I have a *basic understanding* of how **Linked Open Data** works and why **metadata** is important, I am not yet **technically skilled enough** to make use of BUDA’s more advanced research tools such as **SPARQL queries** or the **API**. I see the **potential** — but it lies just *beyond my current abilities*. This, in itself, is a **powerful motivator**: BUDA makes me want to **improve both my Tibetan literacy and my digital skillset** so that I can make **fuller use** of what it offers.

## Final Thoughts: A Platform That Inspires Growth

**BUDA is not just a repository of digital texts** - it is a **platform that invites users to grow**. In my case, it has highlighted both *what I already know* and *what I still want to learn*. It has allowed me to **experience Tibetan Buddhist heritage** in a *new and tangible way*, while also showing me the **tools and knowledge** I need to deepen that experience.

My conclusion is therefore **multifaceted**. I am **thrilled** by the possibilities that BUDA offers. I feel **inspired** as a Tibetan, as a student, and as a practitioner. But I also feel the **gaps in my own abilities**, linguistic and technical, which sometimes make the platform feel just out of reach. 
For someone like me, **BUDA represents more than a digital archive**. It is a **bridge between cultural heritage and technological innovation**, between *past and future*, between *personal believes and academic inquiry*. My hope is that BUDA will continue to grow in ways that support not only **scholars and institutions**, but also **Tibetans**, **digital learners**, and **spiritual seekers** around the world.

This brings my **five-part blog series** on the digitization of Tibetan Buddhist texts to a close. **Thank you for reading!**
