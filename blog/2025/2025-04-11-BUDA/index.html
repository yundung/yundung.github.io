<p>To provide open access to its extensive collection, BDRC developed the Buddhist Digital Archives (BUDA), a powerful online platform that serves as a collaborative archive and research tool. BUDA hosts millions of pages of Buddhist texts, combining high-resolution scans of original manuscripts with digitized electronic texts. The platform’s intuitive design offers a range of tools to support research and study, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Browsing curated collections by tradition, language, or preservation project</li>
  <li>Advanced multi-language search options to find specific texts, authors, or topics</li>
  <li>A high-resolution image viewer for detailed examination of original manuscripts</li>
  <li>An etext reader with translation support for easier reading and comparison</li>
  <li>A linked open data structure that connects people, places, texts, and topics</li>
  <li>The ability to download texts for offline use</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog post highlights how BUDA’s search features and data organization provide invaluable support for researchers, while also demonstrating broader implications for cultural heritage digitization.</p>

<p>BUDA offers an intuitive, yet multifaceted search system that caters to diverse research needs within Tibetan Buddhist studies.</p>

<h3 id="person-search-connecting-biographies-and-texts">Person Search: Connecting Biographies and Texts</h3>

<p>Searching for persons in BUDA reveals detailed biographical profiles, linked writings, and related figures, enriching understanding of historical and religious contexts. Filters for name variants, birth year, role, tradition, and gender help resolve common ambiguities and pinpoint relevant individuals.</p>

<p>This interconnected data reflects the lived networks behind Tibetan Buddhist textual production, supporting both prosopographic studies and traditional scholarship.</p>

<h3 id="place-search-mapping-sacred-geography">Place Search: Mapping Sacred Geography</h3>

<p>Place records provide geographic coordinates, alternative names, and linked persons and texts, enabling spatial exploration of Tibetan Buddhist culture. The interactive map adds a dynamic dimension, inviting users to situate textual materials within their cultural and historical landscapes.</p>

<p>This geospatial approach fosters new perspectives on textual circulation and monastic or pilgrimage sites, expanding the scope of traditional research.</p>

<h3 id="collection-search-accessing-curated-text-groupings">Collection Search: Accessing Curated Text Groupings</h3>

<p>With over 100 collections aggregated, BUDA enables targeted exploration of libraries and archives, filtering by language, author, topic, and print or manuscript status. This allows scholars to balance deep dives into specific corpora with serendipitous discovery across the broader Tibetan textual heritage.</p>

<p>Tracking provenance and collection metadata further anchors research in material history and institutional contexts.</p>

<h3 id="topic-search-thematic-pathways-through-complex-traditions">Topic Search: Thematic Pathways through Complex Traditions</h3>

<p>Thematic search connects researchers with variant terminology and related resources, bridging linguistic and conceptual differences. This feature helps users navigate Buddhist philosophy, ritual, medicine, and more, reflecting BUDA’s role in facilitating interdisciplinary study.</p>
