I am a Master's student in [Central Asian Studies](https://www.philhist.unibe.ch/studies/study_programs/master_s_in_central_asian_studies/index_eng.html) and [Digital Humanities](https://www.philhist.unibe.ch/studies/study_programs/master_minor_digital_humanities/index_eng.html) at the University of Bern and hold a previous Master's degree in Political Science from the University of Zurich. I currently work at the [General Secretariat](https://www.generalsecretariat.uzh.ch/en/stab/team/yundung.html) of the University of Zurich and as an intercultural translator for schools in the city of Zurich.

My Digital Humanities graduation project builds on my Master’s thesis “Digitizing Tibetan Buddhist Texts – An Analysis of Key Tibetan Actors and Their Roles”, which explored how Tibetan actors contribute to cultural preservation through digital innovation. While the thesis focused on selected institutions and people, the current project takes a closer look at the [Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC)](https://www.bdrc.io) — a pioneering platform in the field. By examining BDRC’s tools, technologies, and workflows, the project aims to provide practical insights for users and researchers working with digital Tibetan texts and highlights how BDRC enables broader access, collaboration, and preservation of this important textual heritage.
